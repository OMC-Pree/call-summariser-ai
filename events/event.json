It's been like that most of the week, unfortunately. But say, that's what happens? We don't live on the south coast anymore. 18 00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:24.080 Sean McPike: No, there is. Yeah. There is that advantage of being a bit further south. Alright. 19 00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.060 Suzanne Wildblood: Absolutely, absolutely. 20 00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.040 Sean McPike: Yeah, this is the 1st sun, though in a week. 21 00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.330 Suzanne Wildblood: Always 8. 22 00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.970 Sean McPike: Hmm. 23 00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:40.400 Suzanne Wildblood: Oh, enjoy it, enjoy it. So today's all about introducing you financial plan and the housekeeping. 24 00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.610 Suzanne Wildblood: of course, for training and compliance purposes. Is that okay? 25 00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:45.630 Sean McPike: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 26 00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:55.469 Suzanne Wildblood: Lovely. I'll stop reminding you going forward because it drives everybody crackers. And but if you feel I'm uncomfortable anytime, do let me know, and we can take that. So okay. 27 00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:56.800 Sean McPike: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 28 00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:57.260 Suzanne Wildblood: Brilliant. 29 00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.800 Sean McPike: Tom. 30 00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:08.770 Suzanne Wildblood: So last time we met we went through you goals and and what you're looking to achieve and stay financial plan, and the actions will help you to achieve it. 31 00:03:09.284 --> 00:03:13.999 Suzanne Wildblood: I've done one plan at the moment for you. Normally I like to do a couple. 32 00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:22.589 Suzanne Wildblood: but to look through the options, but I've got some questions for you, because your situation is a little bit less straightforward. The most 33 00:03:23.587 --> 00:03:25.710 Suzanne Wildblood: she's so, and 34 00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:36.219 Suzanne Wildblood: and we can skin it in different ways. So it's it's very collaborative process, anyway. So we'll we'll go through those as as I share share the plan with you. Is that okay? 35 00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:37.510 Sean McPike: Yeah, yeah. 36 00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:38.410 Suzanne Wildblood: Meetings. 37 00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:45.010 Suzanne Wildblood: and and I suspect that once we've had our session, you want to go away and play with it, anyway, and model options. 38 00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:46.280 Suzanne Wildblood: And 39 00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:47.670 Suzanne Wildblood: so 40 00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:56.610 Suzanne Wildblood: there was a couple of actions, wasn't there, that we talked about last time, and one was taken out to Will, wasn't it? Was it updated. 41 00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.309 Sean McPike: Yeah. So when so you sent me a link to that 42 00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.959 Sean McPike: right? Is there a charge for the will? 43 00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.859 Suzanne Wildblood: Through up to Christmas money, or. 44 00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:08.780 Suzanne Wildblood: you see, we we looked at 45 00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.440 Suzanne Wildblood: so you can take out a will with octopus money for free 46 00:04:13.287 --> 00:04:15.860 Suzanne Wildblood: as long as it's a straightforward will. 47 00:04:16.203 --> 00:04:20.539 Suzanne Wildblood: If you want to look at things like power of attorney and trust. 48 00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:22.440 Suzanne Wildblood: then that might be 49 00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.780 Suzanne Wildblood: more. 50 00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:25.909 Suzanne Wildblood: Yeah. Makes sense. 51 00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:27.426 Sean McPike: Yeah, no, there was 52 00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:32.401 Sean McPike: because the will that I wanted to take out was obviously joint. Well for me and my wife. 53 00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:33.910 Sean McPike: And 54 00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:43.059 Sean McPike: they were like, Yeah, well for you, it's 50 off, and then your wife is full of price. And you know the power of attorney piece that costs whatever. 55 00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:49.079 Sean McPike: And so I didn't bother going past the the front page after filling in a few bits. 56 00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:55.015 Sean McPike: So I yeah. Well, what? Whatever that link you sent me 57 00:04:55.510 --> 00:05:00.730 Sean McPike: octopus legacy. It was, yeah, is that right? Legacy? Yeah. And 58 00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:05.120 Sean McPike: it was like, Well, I just don't want a will for me, and I want a joint, will, you know. 59 00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:10.349 Sean McPike: and I don't want to be filling out 2 wells, because I don't need 2 wells. I need one. 60 00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:16.310 Suzanne Wildblood: You should be, you should be able to take out Will. With that code I sent you. 61 00:05:16.617 --> 00:05:21.059 Suzanne Wildblood: and it's and and it's free cause. It costs 135 pounds for a will. 62 00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:32.304 Sean McPike: No, didn't. Wanna it didn't wanna know that I had to register as well on the website, which I thought was a bit odd because I thought it already registered through the octopus money. 63 00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:40.410 Suzanne Wildblood: Separate websites. Yeah, because of Gdpr, you know what you do with us in terms of autopist money and legacy. 64 00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:40.860 Sean McPike: Yeah. 65 00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:42.470 Suzanne Wildblood: 2 different. Things. Yeah. 66 00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:47.659 Sean McPike: Alright. Why don't you send? Why don't can you send me that code again? Then? And I'll. 67 00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:48.020 Suzanne Wildblood: Yeah. 68 00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:51.220 Sean McPike: I'll try. I'll try it again. But May. Maybe there was. 69 00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:54.300 Sean McPike: Maybe the code ran out of the time limit, or whatever. But. 70 00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:59.522 Suzanne Wildblood: No it it that's interesting feedback, Shawn and and 71 00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:04.710 Suzanne Wildblood: because I've I've had couples couples recently. 72 00:06:04.983 --> 00:06:07.790 Suzanne Wildblood: and they've been able to take it out with that code. And 73 00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:09.260 Suzanne Wildblood: right? So. 74 00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.988 Sean McPike: Yeah, maybe I'm just pressing the wrong button. 75 00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:14.200 Sean McPike: possibly. 76 00:06:14.752 --> 00:06:15.517 Suzanne Wildblood: Yeah, it's 77 00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:18.351 Suzanne Wildblood: what what I can do is 78 00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:25.119 Suzanne Wildblood: I can follow up with the team and see what's going on there, because that shouldn't be. The 79 00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:26.720 Suzanne Wildblood: shouldn't be right. 80 00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:27.880 Suzanne Wildblood: Yeah. 81 00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:29.270 Suzanne Wildblood: And. 82 00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:30.170 Sean McPike: Alright, yeah. 83 00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:31.530 Sean McPike: So 84 00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:35.679 Sean McPike: let me see.

So what we'll do is we've got that forecast of 65 at 57. 403 00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:34.850 Sean McPike: So. 404 00:25:37.570 --> 00:25:39.460 Suzanne Wildblood: It sounds like 405 00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:49.020 Suzanne Wildblood: you are on one type of final salary, and then they've moved you on to another type of final salary. Normally, what happens is around that 406 00:25:49.410 --> 00:25:53.380 Suzanne Wildblood: time they would have a defined benefit. 407 00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:57.880 Suzanne Wildblood: and then move on to a defined contribution. 408 00:25:58.270 --> 00:25:59.600 Sean McPike: Yes, that was it. 409 00:25:59.690 --> 00:26:03.319 Sean McPike: Yeah. Cause I still get that final salary 410 00:26:03.770 --> 00:26:05.280 Sean McPike: calculation right? 411 00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:06.560 Suzanne Wildblood: Yeah. 412 00:26:07.007 --> 00:26:16.250 Sean McPike: It was still used to be worked out on what was called this 1 60th thing. Right? So if you did, thi you did 30 years. You got half your pen, you know you got half your salary right? 413 00:26:18.530 --> 00:26:21.030 Sean McPike: and so, but it never cost you anything. 414 00:26:21.650 --> 00:26:23.330 Sean McPike: You'd never had to put money into it. 415 00:26:23.330 --> 00:26:25.000 Suzanne Wildblood: Right. So this is saying. 416 00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.710 Sean McPike: Now now, to go on to the 1 60, th 417 00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:30.950 Sean McPike: you had to put in 5%, and then they put in about 418 00:26:31.390 --> 00:26:32.320 Sean McPike: 20 419 00:26:33.530 --> 00:26:35.129 Sean McPike: 1,000 a year 420 00:26:35.390 --> 00:26:36.499 Sean McPike: on top of that. 421 00:26:36.990 --> 00:26:38.610 Suzanne Wildblood: Yeah, okay. 422 00:26:38.780 --> 00:26:39.780 Suzanne Wildblood: less, yeah. 423 00:26:39.990 --> 00:26:42.229 Sean McPike: And so it works out about, you know. 424 00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:44.580 Sean McPike: 25, 425 00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:49.769 Sean McPike: 30,000 a year is into the pension. Right? 25,000 is into the pension a year. 426 00:26:50.110 --> 00:26:50.740 Suzanne Wildblood: Yeah. 427 00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:53.000 Suzanne Wildblood: Okay, so 428 00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:55.649 Suzanne Wildblood: leave it with me. I'll I'll ask some questions. 429 00:26:55.770 --> 00:27:01.360 Suzanne Wildblood: I'll I'll send you some questions just to just get some clarity around this. 430 00:27:02.790 --> 00:27:16.713 Suzanne Wildblood: Okay? And what we could do is we've got a figure to start with, I think, which is a salary of 60 at 65 or 57 K. So let's start with that, and then we can always. 431 00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:18.510 Sean McPike: Right, yeah. 432 00:27:18.510 --> 00:27:19.080 Suzanne Wildblood: Yeah. 433 00:27:19.310 --> 00:27:20.450 Suzanne Wildblood: Yeah. Good. 434 00:27:20.450 --> 00:27:21.200 Sean McPike: Okay. 435 00:27:21.682 --> 00:27:23.128 Suzanne Wildblood: We'll get there. 436 00:27:23.610 --> 00:27:24.140 Sean McPike: Yeah. 437 00:27:24.561 --> 00:27:33.840 Suzanne Wildblood: And it's it's amazing how how different different pension providers present the information. And you have to dig around in different benefits. 438 00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:35.309 Sean McPike: You know how difficult it is. 439 00:27:35.610 --> 00:27:42.669 Sean McPike: I mean, is it purposely difficult, so that you have to go to somebody else to get more pension advice. I mean, it's absolutely ridiculous. You shouldn't have to. 440 00:27:43.318 --> 00:27:45.911 Suzanne Wildblood: Absolutely. And the government? 441 00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:48.480 Suzanne Wildblood: I I've 442 00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:50.829 Suzanne Wildblood: previous governments of of of 443 00:27:50.880 --> 00:28:04.929 Suzanne Wildblood: issues needed to pension companies to make it simpler and easier for people to understand the pensions. And that's the big driver by getting online a lot of them so recently works online. And still a few that aren't so. 444 00:28:05.270 --> 00:28:05.950 Sean McPike: Yeah. 445 00:28:06.296 --> 00:28:07.680 Suzanne Wildblood: They're coming into the 446 00:28:08.910 --> 00:28:13.425 Suzanne Wildblood: 21st century, maybe maybe 20.th 447 00:28:15.034 --> 00:28:15.819 Sean McPike: Okay. 448 00:28:15.820 --> 00:28:21.599 Suzanne Wildblood: Alright. So we've got some numbers to work on, anyway. If we use that 50, 449 00:28:21.910 --> 00:28:23.940 Suzanne Wildblood: 7%. So 450 00:28:24.390 --> 00:28:30.620 Suzanne Wildblood: great. The other thing I was gonna ask you, was just a bit clarity around 451 00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:34.300 Suzanne Wildblood: your bonuses. So your salaries 90. 452 00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:35.040 Sean McPike: Okay. 453 00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:37.069 Suzanne Wildblood: You get around 454 00:28:38.250 --> 00:28:41.099 Suzanne Wildblood: so 20% in cash. 455 00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:42.540 Suzanne Wildblood: Thank you. 456 00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:43.409 Sean McPike: Dash, yeah. 457 00:28:43.410 --> 00:28:44.180 Suzanne Wildblood: In 458 00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:47.809 Suzanne Wildblood: March, and then you get shares in February, don't you. 459 00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:48.680 Sean McPike: Yes. 460 00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:53.549 Suzanne Wildblood: What roughly does the value work out in shares. 461 00:28:54.650 --> 00:28:59.979 Sean McPike: So well, this is the thing. If the share price goes up. Obviously 462 00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:01.720 Sean McPike: so 463 00:29:02.597 --> 00:29:04.540 Sean McPike: this coming year 464 00:29:07.030 --> 00:29:11.700 Sean McPike: I've got.

So that's 32 475 00:29:41.270 --> 00:29:43.629 Sean McPike: plus force, 36,000. 476 00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:48.170 Suzanne Wildblood: Is that typical around that. 477 00:29:48.170 --> 00:29:52.789 Sean McPike: Nope, Nope, not at all, not at all. It's only because the share price so high. 478 00:29:52.790 --> 00:29:53.200 Suzanne Wildblood: Okay. 479 00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:55.409 Sean McPike: Would norm.

Okay. 601 00:36:47.540 --> 00:36:48.040 Sean McPike: Got it. 602 00:36:48.040 --> 00:37:03.950 Suzanne Wildblood: Alright. What I want to do is go into your profile. Just want to check the underlying data in your plan. So I've got your date to birth. This is 28 from the 972. You're based in sunny Southampton and Vicky State to birth, supporting the 1272. 603 00:37:05.110 --> 00:37:05.895 Suzanne Wildblood: And 604 00:37:06.710 --> 00:37:12.330 Suzanne Wildblood: your salary is 19,000. Your average sort of cash bonus is 18. 605 00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:13.930 Suzanne Wildblood: I'm 606 00:37:14.050 --> 00:37:20.220 Suzanne Wildblood: Vicki's is 12,000. Sally is 12,500. She doesn't get any bonuses or anything. Does she? Nope. 607 00:37:20.650 --> 00:37:23.370 Suzanne Wildblood: now, what I'm going to do is 608 00:37:24.050 --> 00:37:29.340 Suzanne Wildblood: I'm gonna switch off for the moment. This is your defined contribution pension. 609 00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:30.970 Suzanne Wildblood: Einste. 610 00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:37.030 Suzanne Wildblood: I'm gonna switch that off for the moment, and I'm gonna put we can put it back in later. 611 00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:42.620 Suzanne Wildblood: What I'm gonna do is, say that you'll define benefit based on what we saw 612 00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:47.330 Suzanne Wildblood: is 57,000 at 65. 613 00:37:51.140 --> 00:37:53.379 Suzanne Wildblood: What I'm wondering is is 614 00:37:54.960 --> 00:38:00.119 Suzanne Wildblood: depending how they present the information. Because I know you've got your your 615 00:38:00.790 --> 00:38:06.220 Suzanne Wildblood: additional contributions as well. Let's see what number we can get to it. Does that make sense. 616 00:38:06.540 --> 00:38:06.979 Sean McPike: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 617 00:38:06.980 --> 00:38:08.870 Suzanne Wildblood: But then we can work from that. 618 00:38:09.931 --> 00:38:12.750 Suzanne Wildblood: Is? Is Vicky paying into a pension? Do you know. 619 00:38:12.750 --> 00:38:13.340 Sean McPike: Note. 620 00:38:13.580 --> 00:38:14.486 Suzanne Wildblood: Okay, cool. 621 00:38:15.050 --> 00:38:20.860 Suzanne Wildblood: So in terms of cash savings, you've got 2,000 pound in cash savings at the moment. Do you. 622 00:38:20.860 --> 00:38:21.180 Sean McPike: Yeah. 623 00:38:21.180 --> 00:38:23.530 Suzanne Wildblood: I get into your cash savings. 624 00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:24.430 Sean McPike: No. 625 00:38:24.430 --> 00:38:26.209 Suzanne Wildblood: Okay? And then 626 00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:33.709 Suzanne Wildblood: we've got the investments where you've got around 90,000 in shares, and you pay 50 pounds a month into that. 627 00:38:33.710 --> 00:38:34.400 Sean McPike: Yes. 628 00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:37.370 Suzanne Wildblood: Okay, gonna put your other shares in differently. 629 00:38:37.570 --> 00:38:38.710 Suzanne Wildblood: I'm 630 00:38:39.190 --> 00:38:52.780 Suzanne Wildblood: we've got your mortgage of 1,750. So General spend bills, etc, 4,435, and then we've got 530. That's on your credit card and your personal line. 631 00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:55.210 Suzanne Wildblood: Perfect. Good. 632 00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:58.740 Suzanne Wildblood: Okay, so 633 00:38:58.910 --> 00:39:00.609 Suzanne Wildblood: let me just 634 00:39:00.750 --> 00:39:02.229 Suzanne Wildblood: update that 635 00:39:04.190 --> 00:39:06.590 Suzanne Wildblood: right? So this is your finance 636 00:39:06.610 --> 00:39:08.190 Suzanne Wildblood: financial plan. 637 00:39:10.380 --> 00:39:11.290 Suzanne Wildblood: Ant. 638 00:39:15.190 --> 00:39:16.960 Suzanne Wildblood: Right? So 639 00:39:18.530 --> 00:39:20.989 Suzanne Wildblood: what you can see here. 640 00:39:25.260 --> 00:39:26.050 Suzanne Wildblood: Aye. 641 00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:29.330 Suzanne Wildblood: oh, not having a good day today. 642 00:39:29.690 --> 00:39:30.999 Suzanne Wildblood: Just bear with me. 643 00:39:32.820 --> 00:39:34.630 Suzanne Wildblood: This is what it should be looking like. 644 00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:37.803 Suzanne Wildblood: and we've got your 645 00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:49.950 Suzanne Wildblood: Let me go go with this one for the moment, because this is what it should be looking like. Looks like we've got an arrow in the plan that I've just changed. But I'll come back to that. And 646 00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:57.669 Suzanne Wildblood: so this is a financial plan. So it's showing you from now until retirement. We've got you retiring at 62 at the moment 647 00:39:57.920 --> 00:39:58.920 Suzanne Wildblood: I'm 648 00:39:59.650 --> 00:40:05.565 Suzanne Wildblood: so what you can see, here is anything in yellow as you mentioned anything in 649 00:40:06.030 --> 00:40:08.459 Suzanne Wildblood: pink is your emergency fund. 650 00:40:08.570 --> 00:40:14.669 Suzanne Wildblood: So this is what we talked about is building the cash to give you that financial cushion to fall back on 651 00:40:15.348 --> 00:40:21.029 Suzanne Wildblood: and anything in in blues, your investments. And what it's telling you here is that 652 00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:29.676 Suzanne Wildblood: 3 times you take and pace. What we generally recommend is the emergency fund. So that's 20,600. Does that make sense? 653 00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:32.500 Suzanne Wildblood: So 654 00:40:32.610 --> 00:40:40.220 Suzanne Wildblood: what we've got in here? If it's if I show you this, this is all where we keep the underlying data that we discussed. 655 00:40:41.150 --> 00:40:46.709 Suzanne Wildblood: And what you can see here. I've got the loans and the credit cards being paid off as well. 656 00:40:47.221 --> 00:40:54.389 Suzanne Wildblood: and you'd be mortgage 3 in 2034. Now I guess that when when's your mortgage due to be paid off? 657 00:40:54.830 --> 00:40:55.400 Suzanne Wildblood: Do you remember. 658 00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:59.079 Sean McPike: And August 34. But we're gonna start overpaying next year. 659 00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:04.580 Suzanne Wildblood: Yeah. Okay. So that's 1 of the things that we want to model isn't modeling, paying. 660 00:41:04.970 --> 00:41:05.610 Sean McPike: Yeah. 661 00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:11.909 Suzanne Wildblood: I've got a handy calculator. Have you got a calculator for that? 662 00:41:12.714 --> 00:41:15.779 Sean McPike: No, no, if you can send me a link for it, that'd be great. 663 00:41:15.780 --> 00:41:16.400 Suzanne Wildblood: Yet. 664 00:41:16.930 --> 00:41:18.940 Suzanne Wildblood: and so we can have a look at that. 665 00:41:18.950 --> 00:41:28.200 Suzanne Wildblood: But let's get orientated around this. So there's some growth rates here. Assumptions. We allow for 2% inflation 666 00:41:28.430 --> 00:41:36.939 Suzanne Wildblood: and on investments and pensions. And they're very conservative growth rates. So this is presenting, you know, worst case scenario, if you like 667 00:41:37.130 --> 00:41:45.769 Suzanne Wildblood: with your pensions, the growth rate is assumed at 5.0 5%. And your investments is the the growth rate is 2.0 2%? 668 00:41:47.068 --> 00:41:48.580 Suzanne Wildblood: Does that make sense. 669 00:41:48.980 --> 00:41:49.740 Sean McPike: Yep. Yeah. 670 00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:50.530 Suzanne Wildblood: So 671 00:41:52.280 --> 00:42:00.640 Suzanne Wildblood: what it's showing is we've got a number of things going on. I've put 2 goals in there for you, which is the 672 00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:04.110 Suzanne Wildblood: supporting your children through university 673 00:42:04.580 --> 00:42:05.310 Suzanne Wildblood: yet. 674 00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:06.660 Suzanne Wildblood: Ans. 675 00:42:07.630 --> 00:42:13.840 Suzanne Wildblood: what it does, it takes the default. So we can change the figures, because I know you talked about 5 and 6, 676 00:42:14.380 --> 00:42:17.940 Suzanne Wildblood: 2, 5 and 6,000. Naturally. 677 00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:22.040 Suzanne Wildblood: the default now is let me show you is gone up. 678 00:42:22.660 --> 00:42:25.130 Suzanne Wildblood: So this is a widget that we use. 679 00:42:25.741 --> 00:42:30.710 Suzanne Wildblood: and it shows you the average sort of cost to cover 680 00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:35.740 Suzanne Wildblood: accommodation and living cost is about 8,285. 681 00:42:35.740 --> 00:42:36.729 Sean McPike: Okay. Yep. 682 00:42:37.160 --> 00:42:40.059 Suzanne Wildblood: So we can go with that, or we can reduce it. It's up to you. 683 00:42:40.190 --> 00:42:41.430 Sean McPike: No, no, we'll go with that. Yeah. 684 00:42:41.430 --> 00:42:45.079 Suzanne Wildblood: Okay, I've got your son's date of birth around about right. 685 00:42:45.632 --> 00:42:49.499 Sean McPike: Is it? He is 29 0 3. 686 00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:53.280 Suzanne Wildblood: Yep. 687 00:42:54.270 --> 00:42:56.429 Sean McPike: And then 2,009 is right. 688 00:42:56.430 --> 00:42:57.440 Suzanne Wildblood: Perfect. 689 00:42:59.050 --> 00:43:00.370 Suzanne Wildblood: Okay? And then. 690 00:43:00.700 --> 00:43:03.569 Sean McPike: Yeah. And then my daughter's is is different. 691 00:43:04.250 --> 00:43:05.380 Sean McPike: She's 692 00:43:06.090 --> 00:43:07.330 Sean McPike: 9, 693 00:43:07.830 --> 00:43:09.229 Sean McPike: 1010. 694 00:43:14.050 --> 00:43:14.890 Suzanne Wildblood: Effects, but. 695 00:43:14.890 --> 00:43:16.083 Sean McPike: Yeah. Done. 696 00:43:19.300 --> 00:43:21.150 Suzanne Wildblood: So this is our starting point. 697 00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:24.140 Suzanne Wildblood: What you can see is, there's a 698 00:43:24.390 --> 00:43:33.759 Suzanne Wildblood: a bit of a dip going on, and this is when we've got and accommodating the university. So how it's looking. This is the spending panel. 699 00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:38.740 Suzanne Wildblood: and what you can see here is the black line is your income. 700 00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:44.933 Suzanne Wildblood: and obviously we haven't put any provisions in there for potential pay rises. 701 00:43:45.710 --> 00:43:49.020 Suzanne Wildblood: The great excuse me, is your outgoings. 702 00:43:50.450 --> 00:43:57.300 Suzanne Wildblood: So what you can see there is. We've got that 150 pound which I know is coming going into shares. 703 00:43:57.330 --> 00:44:00.300 Suzanne Wildblood: But that's the spare that we have. 704 00:44:01.010 --> 00:44:06.900 Suzanne Wildblood: So any white in between the black line and the gray you're outgoing. This is potentially how much you can save. 705 00:44:06.900 --> 00:44:07.830 Sean McPike: Spare. Yeah. 706 00:44:07.830 --> 00:44:13.540 Suzanne Wildblood: Yeah. What you see is, it's dipping down, obviously. And you're not going to reducing what you've paid 707 00:44:13.690 --> 00:44:16.270 Suzanne Wildblood: one of you. I think you should credit card. 708 00:44:16.270 --> 00:44:17.290 Sean McPike: That's right. 709 00:44:18.710 --> 00:44:24.140 Suzanne Wildblood: So it's freeing up 681 pounds once they're both paid off, which you know that way. But. 710 00:44:24.140 --> 00:44:24.700 Sean McPike: Yeah, yeah. 711 00:44:24.700 --> 00:44:25.470 Suzanne Wildblood: I'm 712 00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:32.829 Suzanne Wildblood: these blue lines here. So that blue block is your summons university that 8,000 that we talked about 713 00:44:33.340 --> 00:44:34.250 Suzanne Wildblood: I'm 714 00:44:34.580 --> 00:44:40.769 Suzanne Wildblood: and the next block is your daughter's university. So you've you've got your double there. 715 00:44:41.878 --> 00:44:54.459 Suzanne Wildblood: What's showing is that cash flow panel? That black panel is showing you the numbers as I move it along month by month, it's showing you what's coming in, what's going out. And if this any 716 00:44:55.110 --> 00:44:57.630 Suzanne Wildblood: extra money, or if there's a deficit. 717 00:44:59.450 --> 00:45:00.260 Suzanne Wildblood: So 718 00:45:00.450 --> 00:45:03.459 Suzanne Wildblood: what it that maps onto this 719 00:45:03.780 --> 00:45:06.699 Suzanne Wildblood: is, if I scroll along. 720 00:45:06.900 --> 00:45:08.660 Suzanne Wildblood: What we see is 721 00:45:09.820 --> 00:45:18.390 Suzanne Wildblood: the black panel is suggesting rather than putting that 150 pounds into shares. Is that put it into emergency fund? 722 00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:24.839 Suzanne Wildblood: Because that's 1 of the key foundations for financial security. 723 00:45:25.970 --> 00:45:35.119 Suzanne Wildblood: So your key foundation. So you insurances. You will manage any cash flow which you're doing anyway, and having that emergency fund in place. 724 00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:40.420 Sean McPike: Yeah, so that 150 shares the moment that's a share, save scheme. 725 00:45:40.420 --> 00:45:41.609 Suzanne Wildblood: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 726 00:45:41.610 --> 00:45:45.770 Sean McPike: So that's the tax efficient share, save scheme. So it's not 150 quid. It's 727 00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:48.390 Sean McPike: it's 90 quid. 728 00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:51.580 Suzanne Wildblood: So that's 90 pounds that's coming out of your 729 00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:52.820 Suzanne Wildblood: okay. Yes. 730 00:45:52.820 --> 00:45:53.460 Sean McPike: Yeah. 731 00:45:53.600 --> 00:45:58.249 Sean McPike: it's converted into 150 quid because it's tax. It's tax. If you you don't pay anything. 732 00:45:58.250 --> 00:45:59.600 Suzanne Wildblood: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 733 00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:00.200 Sean McPike: On it. 734 00:46:00.630 --> 00:46:01.470 Suzanne Wildblood: Okay. 735 00:46:01.470 --> 00:46:02.070 Sean McPike: Yet. 736 00:46:02.250 --> 00:46:05.868 Suzanne Wildblood: Alrighty. I need to change that then. So what I'll do is. 737 00:46:14.620 --> 00:46:17.380 Sean McPike: And actually, if I didn't pay that 90 quid 738 00:46:18.370 --> 00:46:19.370 Sean McPike: at the minute 739 00:46:20.290 --> 00:46:23.310 Sean McPike: because of my, they might tax, I'm paying 740 00:46:23.340 --> 00:46:26.139 Sean McPike: beyond 120. It'll be 60%. 741 00:46:26.140 --> 00:46:27.070 Suzanne Wildblood: Yeah, exactly. 742 00:46:27.070 --> 00:46:27.920 Sean McPike: It'll be like. 743 00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:29.009 Sean McPike: yeah, you know. 744 00:46:29.420 --> 00:46:34.980 Sean McPike: So I I was actually trying to increase the amount I would share saving 745 00:46:35.650 --> 00:46:42.809 Sean McPike: just for that tax benefit. But I I can only maximum. I can share a save, and it must be because of tax. Tax. Month 746 00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:44.490 Sean McPike: is a hundred 50 a month. 747 00:46:44.600 --> 00:46:46.399 Sean McPike: Which is why I say that. Yeah. 748 00:46:46.600 --> 00:46:48.040 Suzanne Wildblood: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 749 00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:49.889 Suzanne Wildblood: yeah. So. 750 00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:51.910 Suzanne Wildblood: but I think 751 00:46:54.150 --> 00:46:56.599 Suzanne Wildblood: what I need to do is go and update this. 752 00:46:57.520 --> 00:47:08.295 Suzanne Wildblood: And but what I want to do show you the principles for how the plans working. And then, when we you've had to look at the the pensions, and I've I had to look at some of these numbers as well. What you can. 753 00:47:08.860 --> 00:47:12.760 Suzanne Wildblood: You can understand how it's being interpreted in the plan. If that makes sense. 754 00:47:12.760 --> 00:47:13.569 Sean McPike: Yes, and. 755 00:47:14.850 --> 00:47:20.339 Suzanne Wildblood: But I think one sort of the key message really is is building up a cash fund. 756 00:47:20.570 --> 00:47:21.010 Sean McPike: Yes. 757 00:47:21.010 --> 00:47:23.390 Suzanne Wildblood: You know. Put it into a cash, Isa. 758 00:47:24.145 --> 00:47:27.830 Suzanne Wildblood: You've both got that cache is allowance, haven't you? Between you. 759 00:47:28.978 --> 00:47:32.002 Suzanne Wildblood: If you want to hold any money in 760 00:47:33.150 --> 00:47:40.089 Suzanne Wildblood: a normal, easy access account, like a general easy access account, put it in your wife's name because she can earn a thousand pound in 761 00:47:40.460 --> 00:47:41.960 Suzanne Wildblood: interests. 762 00:47:42.721 --> 00:47:45.889 Suzanne Wildblood: And before you start paying tax on that interest. 763 00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:47.500 Suzanne Wildblood: And 764 00:47:47.790 --> 00:47:52.659 Suzanne Wildblood: so it's it's it's optimizing the savings tax allowances as well. 765 00:47:53.090 --> 00:47:54.080 Suzanne Wildblood: Yep. 766 00:47:54.670 --> 00:47:55.420 Suzanne Wildblood: yep. 767 00:47:55.520 --> 00:47:57.330 Sean McPike: And that's just a standard. 768 00:47:58.070 --> 00:48:02.669 Sean McPike: Easy, is it? Is it? That's just a standard ice, is it that anybody does? Yeah. 769 00:48:02.860 --> 00:48:04.689 Suzanne Wildblood: Yeah, an easy access is so. 770 00:48:04.920 --> 00:48:07.230 Suzanne Wildblood: and I can find you one. 771 00:48:07.430 --> 00:48:08.400 Suzanne Wildblood: Yeah. And 772 00:48:09.230 --> 00:48:11.140 Suzanne Wildblood: and we can, we can look at that. 773 00:48:11.657 --> 00:48:29.210 Suzanne Wildblood: So what? What the reason behind the Emergency fund is is obviously the 1st one is, if either of you lost your job, then you can cover your bills. Now I know, with your salary, and your wife's salary is a huge variance, and you probably just absorb it. But, the 774 00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:33.040 Suzanne Wildblood: the flip side is also, if you need cash quickly. 775 00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:41.280 Suzanne Wildblood: Any money's tied up in shares. It's where do you get that cash from? Because it can take a while to convert those shares into cash. 776 00:48:41.460 --> 00:48:42.090 Sean McPike: Yeah. 777 00:48:42.440 --> 00:48:44.590 Suzanne Wildblood: And also if the market dips. 778 00:48:44.820 --> 00:48:54.209 Suzanne Wildblood: then you know you more reluctant on you to want to to convert shares into cash. So it gives you that legal room, if you like. 779 00:48:54.460 --> 00:48:55.710 Sean McPike: Yeah, yeah. 780 00:48:56.770 --> 00:49:06.609 Suzanne Wildblood: So so that's why it's suggesting that. And I appreciate it's less straightforward for you. And but if your shares strong, I wonder if 781 00:49:07.110 --> 00:49:11.489 Suzanne Wildblood: it's an option to convert some of them into cash rather than 782 00:49:12.220 --> 00:49:15.239 Suzanne Wildblood: diverting money into cash, is it? That's the person. 783 00:49:15.240 --> 00:49:15.940 Sean McPike: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 784 00:49:15.940 --> 00:49:16.982 Suzanne Wildblood: I think something. 785 00:49:17.330 --> 00:49:18.479 Sean McPike: Yeah, I know what you mean. 786 00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:19.689 Suzanne Wildblood: So that makes sense. 787 00:49:19.850 --> 00:49:21.452 Sean McPike: Yeah, yeah, yeah, it does. Yeah. 788 00:49:21.750 --> 00:49:24.989 Sean McPike: Yeah. But I'll get some. I'll get somebody at the door just to need to open this. 789 00:49:24.990 --> 00:49:26.130 Suzanne Wildblood: Okay? No. Problem. 790 00:49:26.130 --> 00:49:28.999 Sean McPike: And I've got. I've got a guy coming to see me in half 11 791 00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:30.600 Sean McPike: regularly. 792 00:49:33.600 --> 00:49:36.480 Sean McPike: Yes, yes, I'll be 5 min. Then you come 793 00:49:37.210 --> 00:49:38.240 Sean McPike: right? 794 00:49:41.090 --> 00:49:43.490 Sean McPike: Right? Yeah, we got 5. 795 00:49:43.490 --> 00:49:45.699 Suzanne Wildblood: Yeah, no problem. So 796 00:49:47.120 --> 00:49:57.549 Suzanne Wildblood: what we'll do is, I think we'll leave it there for now. And what this is a snapshot of your retirement. And it's this is wrong. These numbers are wrong. 797 00:49:57.963 --> 00:50:12.520 Suzanne Wildblood: And that's just because I would. I just need to go back and update this. But what is also missing, for here is your future share payments. So what I need to do is add those in because they will appear as a spike. 798 00:50:12.840 --> 00:50:15.629 Suzanne Wildblood: and they'll go straight into your investments. 799 00:50:16.262 --> 00:50:20.039 Suzanne Wildblood: and what I can also do is model. 800 00:50:21.060 --> 00:50:22.850 Suzanne Wildblood: We look at your pension 801 00:50:22.860 --> 00:50:27.140 Suzanne Wildblood: if you want to increase, adding, what 20 K. 802 00:50:28.210 --> 00:50:29.120 Suzanne Wildblood: Tension. 803 00:50:33.800 --> 00:50:36.620 Suzanne Wildblood: I'll I'll I'll just show you how it works. 804 00:50:36.710 --> 00:50:39.989 Suzanne Wildblood: So if you get your payments in February. 805 00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:44.554 Suzanne Wildblood: maybe go into Pension March just for sake of. 806 00:50:45.010 --> 00:50:45.630 Sean McPike: Hmm. 807 00:50:46.590 --> 00:50:47.230 Suzanne Wildblood: No. 808 00:50:47.740 --> 00:50:48.180 Sean McPike: 5. 809 00:50:48.180 --> 00:50:50.829 Suzanne Wildblood: You get it in March, don't you? You pay cash. 810 00:50:50.830 --> 00:50:53.309 Sean McPike: I'll get it in. March. Yeah. So yeah. 811 00:50:53.530 --> 00:51:02.370 Suzanne Wildblood: So 25. What I can do is put a sharp increase in there and increase that to. I think it will be working out about 30 cents. 812 00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:03.200 Sean McPike: Hmm. 813 00:51:06.740 --> 00:51:07.730 Suzanne Wildblood: And 814 00:51:10.360 --> 00:51:11.650 Suzanne Wildblood: so where are we. 815 00:51:13.950 --> 00:51:14.700 Suzanne Wildblood: Hook? 816 00:51:16.350 --> 00:51:19.910 Suzanne Wildblood: What I should see is is a jump into your pension 817 00:51:20.460 --> 00:51:37.829 Suzanne Wildblood: on this cash flow, but it's not appearing, so I need to go. Look at this. Leave leave it with me, and what I'll do is I'll put. Do you think you want to pop? Follow the model. If, if, assuming that you get 18,000 each year, putting 20 k. Into your pension each year. 818 00:51:38.630 --> 00:51:39.870 Suzanne Wildblood: I'm 819 00:51:39.980 --> 00:51:41.969 Suzanne Wildblood: so I'll I'll fill that in and. 820 00:51:41.970 --> 00:51:44.839 Sean McPike: Yeah, I put, I put in the 5%. And then, whatever the 821 00:51:45.650 --> 00:51:47.642 Sean McPike: whatever that difference is. 822 00:51:48.440 --> 00:51:51.909 Suzanne Wildblood: Cause you can put to 60,000 a year into your pension. 823 00:51:52.230 --> 00:51:54.839 Sean McPike: Yeah, that annual allowance thing, though. 824 00:51:55.680 --> 00:51:57.090 Sean McPike: That 1 million pound. 825 00:51:57.720 --> 00:51:59.080 Suzanne Wildblood: Oh, that's that's. 826 00:51:59.080 --> 00:51:59.750 Sean McPike: Time. 827 00:51:59.900 --> 00:52:03.509 Suzanne Wildblood: Yeah, that's a lifetime pension allowance at the moment. That's not. 828 00:52:04.040 --> 00:52:07.639 Suzanne Wildblood: That's not in in and enforced 829 00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:15.710 Suzanne Wildblood: at the moment. So that was taken away by the Conservative Government a few years ago, and labor as part of their 830 00:52:16.706 --> 00:52:24.320 Suzanne Wildblood: manifesto said, they don't have plans to reintroduce it, whether they will or not. It's a different thing now they're in power. 831 00:52:24.871 --> 00:52:27.470 Suzanne Wildblood: But yes, that is a good point. 832 00:52:28.810 --> 00:52:30.000 Suzanne Wildblood: I'm yeah. 833 00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:30.670 Sean McPike: Yes. 834 00:52:31.040 --> 00:52:41.890 Suzanne Wildblood: So I'll send you a list of the questions around the pensions. Let's try and drill into that. I will update you plans based on the quite the conversation you've had today, so we can get it closer. 835 00:52:41.970 --> 00:52:47.269 Suzanne Wildblood: And what I'll do is I'll I'll send you a link to it. It's probably no point in 836 00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:51.809 Suzanne Wildblood: logging into it just yet until I've done the updates now 837 00:52:52.360 --> 00:52:54.470 Suzanne Wildblood: with the updates, and 838 00:52:54.740 --> 00:52:57.940 Suzanne Wildblood: I'm actually off on holiday on Sunday for a week 839 00:52:58.460 --> 00:52:59.510 Suzanne Wildblood: so. 840 00:52:59.720 --> 00:53:05.010 Suzanne Wildblood: and if I don't get them done before I go away, I'll have to do them when I come back. Obviously. 841 00:53:05.336 --> 00:53:05.989 Sean McPike: Yeah. Yeah. 842 00:53:06.500 --> 00:53:12.929 Suzanne Wildblood: But don't worry, because usually I have 2 meetings over 3 months. I'll we'll have an extra meeting 843 00:53:12.990 --> 00:53:17.699 Suzanne Wildblood: just to make sure that we can, finishing everything off and get you to a good point.
