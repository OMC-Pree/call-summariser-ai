This is the standard for good performance.\n- \"CompetentWithDevelopment\": The coach met the requirement but there are areas for improvement. The core requirement was satisfied but execution could be better.\n- \"Fail\": The requirement was missed, incorrect, explicitly prohibited, or violated compliance rules.\n- \"NotApplicable\": This check does not apply to this specific session (e.g., client is not over 50 for age-specific checks).\n- \"Inconclusive\": Insufficient evidence to make a clear judgment.\n\nASSESSMENT RULES:\n- Use 'Competent' when the coach clearly fulfilled the requirement with good quality evidence.\n- Use 'CompetentWithDevelopment' when the requirement was met but could be improved (e.g., brief confirmation instead of thorough discussion).\n- Use 'Fail' when the requirement was missed, incorrect, or explicitly prohibited (like giving regulated advice or steering).\n- Use 'NotApplicable' if the check does not apply to this session.\n- Use 'Inconclusive' only if there's genuinely not enough evidence to make a judgment.\n\nEVIDENCE & COMMENTS:\n- Always provide specific evidence quotes from the transcript when available.\n- Evidence quotes should be actual dialogue excerpts, not summaries.\n- Comments should explain WHY you assigned the status and what could be improved (for CompetentWithDevelopment) or what went wrong (for Fail).\n- Set 'evidence_quote' and 'comment' to empty string ('') only if truly unavailable.\n\nCOMPLIANCE VIOLATIONS:\n- If the coach gives regulated financial advice (specific product recommendations) \u2192 'Fail'\n- If the coach uses steering language (\"the best route\", \"you should\", \"I would do\") \u2192 'Fail'\n- If high-severity compliance items are missed \u2192 'Fail'\n\nMETADATA:\n- Set meeting_id EXACTLY to \"{{meeting_id}}\".\n- Set model_version EXACTLY to \"{{model_version}}\".\n- Set prompt_version EXACTLY to \"{{prompt_version}}\".\n- \"evidence_quote\" and \"comment\" must be strings; if unavailable use \"\" (empty string), not null.\n- If any other value is unknown, use null (not placeholders like \"[REDACTED]\").\n\n{{kb_examples}}\n\nCHECKLIST:\n{{checklist_json}}\n\nCLEANED_TRANSCRIPT:\n{{cleaned_transcript}}"
